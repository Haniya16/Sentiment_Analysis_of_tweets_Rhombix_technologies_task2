## Sentiment analysis of tweets using logistic regression.
In this repository its a simple easy task of sentiment analysis of kaggle data using Logistic Regression where we phase the class imbalance issue to also make some new prediction on new give tweets.
Simply using Logistic regression and after handle imbalancing usin SMOTE I get 69% accracy from the 50% as a beginner it is ok for me but for more accuracy if we apply other models like SVM, Random Forest. we get more accuracy
But using Logistice regression and TD-IDF vectorization and scaling feature its new for me.
